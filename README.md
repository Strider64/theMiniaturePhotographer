# The Miniature Photographer

The Miniature Photographer website is my main website that shows off my photography and website designer/developer skills. I use straight HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP to develop my websites and
majority of my PHP is Object-Oriented Programming. This means I am able to develop websites fairly fast and I do my best to keep up with the latest coding techniques when it comes Javascript
and PHP. I use NO Framworks or Libraries in my coding as I like trying to keep my websites fast and reliable. I do use a 3rd Party Emailer as I find it more robust and secure than coding my own. I 
am suppling my HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascree free here at Github as I feel a person still needs to know what they are doing when it comes to developing a website. 

If you want me to to design and develop a website for you the only thing I ask is to have creative control over the website, plus I will only do both (design and develop). I will provide 
a mockup of the website for you approval as afterall it is your website. I will NOT use any copyright content including images and videos for the design of the website. Like I said I 
have the creative control when it comes to how the website looks with your final approval before I start the development phase of the website. A contract or written agreement will have 
to be drawn up between us until I actually start to work on it. 

All prices will be mention in the contract/agreement and any changes to the design or development of the website will occur additional charges unless the change is minor or somethhing that
both of us agree upon. I only do legit businesses websites and I do no design/develop any porn sites or websites of questionable nature. Any payment systems or shopping carts will be done 
by a 3rd party as I leave that part up to businesses that know what they are doing when it comes to keeping money transactions secure. My websites are secure when it comes to
registration/login systems and content management systems, plus NO emails will be used by other parties except payment/shopping cart systems.
